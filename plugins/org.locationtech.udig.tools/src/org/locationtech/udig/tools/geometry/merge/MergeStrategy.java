 * Strategy for union of geometries.
 * 
 * For Polygon and Point it makes the union defined by JTS, but for 
 * lineString and multiLineString it has the next behaviour:
 * 
 *  - Merge 2 or more lineStrings, if the result could be a simple lineString
 *   with 1 geometry, it does, doesn't matter the layer feature type(on JTS union,
 *    if the feature type is MultiLineString, the union of 3 lineString will be a MultiLineString 
 *    with 3 geometries.)
 *  - Merge 2 or more lineString, and the result couldn't be a simple lineString, so, it creates
 *  a MultiLineString with as many geometries as lineStrings are merged.
