/**
 * An extension interface allowing an EventBehaviour to Lock the tool handler.
 * <p>
 * Certain types of events need to be able to "lock" the tool handler
 * so that it is the only event getting events until it "unlocks" the tool handler.
 * </p><p>
 * Example:
 * </p><p>
 * The Polygon tool has a BoxSelection behaviour that accepts drag events and draws a 
 * rectangle until the mouse is released (at that point it selects the vertices that are with 
 * the box).  
 * </p><p>
 * The Polygon tool also has a move geometry behaviour that moves the geometry when the mouse
 * is dragged over an {@link EditGeom}.  
 * </p><p> 
 * Given these two behaviours the following case can occur:  The mouse is pressed (not over a 
 * geometry) and the BoxSelection behaviour starts drawing the selection box.  The mouse drags
 * over a Geometry and the MoveGeometry behaviour starts as well.  
 * </p><p>
 * One solution is to put both behaviours in a {@link org.locationtech.udig.tools.edit.MutualExclusiveEventBehavior} so that if the BoxSelection
 * behaviour is running then the MoveGeometryBehaviour won't.  However if the MoveGeometryBehaviour
 * starts then the BoxSelection behaviour may as well.
 * </p>
