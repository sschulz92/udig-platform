/**
 * Public base class for configuring the UDIG workbench.
 * <p>
 * Note that the workbench advisor object is created in advance of creating the workbench. However,
 * by the time the workbench starts calling methods on this class,
 * <code>PlatformUI.getWorkbench</code> is guaranteed to have been properly initialized.
 * <p>
 * If you wanted to perform any system startup checks please
 * look into overriding the UDIGApplication or UDIGStartup in addition to this class.
 * <p>
 * Most of the structure of the UDIGApplication is dictated by the Eclipse User Interface
 * Guidelines; we have had to supplement this advice in a few places in order to document the
 * conventions we are following when working with spatial content.
 * <p>
 * If you are used to Eclipse RCP development you fill find that everything is normal; our main
 * Editor (ie MapEditor) is *modal* and changes what it is up to based on the current tool. This
 * results in the contents of the Edit menu changing a bit more often then what you are used to when
 * working with a Text editor (where the only kind of content is selected text).
