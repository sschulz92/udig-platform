/**
 * Item listed in a map legend (including folders, layers and in the future
 * style based categories generated from the current style).
 * <p>
 * The purpose of these classes is to communicate the information being displayed; rather than
 * to strictly control draw order and display. As such we can show/hide individual LegendItems
 * from the legend (if for example they are not considered interesting to the task at hand).
 * <p>
 * These are focused on the legend and define the Icon and "Display Name" presented
 * to the end user. This is based on what information the map is trying to communicate and
 * does not have to directly match the name of the IGeoResource being displayed.
 * <p>
 * For example during disaster response a dataset of "urban zone planning" may be repurposed and
 * displayed in the legend as "Expected Population Densisity" (given a few assumptions about time
 * of day and the location of commuters).
