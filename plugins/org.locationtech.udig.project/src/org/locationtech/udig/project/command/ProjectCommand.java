/**
 * A Command in uDig describes an action that modifies the system's model.
 * <p>
 * Commands are single fire objects. They cannot be used more than once. This is to allow undoable
 * commands to be a normal command, not a special case command.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Commands normally have factories associated with them, but they are also prototypes. The copy
 * method returns a new Command without the undo data. The new Command can safely be executed with
 * no negative side-effects.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see A set of possible command categories are: zoom, pan, cut, paste, addVertex, etc.. Most
 *      commands are associated with tool whose job is to construct the commands. A Command object
 *      describes an concrete change, for example: setBBox(0,0,1,1); setBBox(2,2,3,3) would be a
 *      separate object.
