/**
 * This is a work queue for re-using a group of threads to do Tile work. An example use is the work
 * of saving tiles to disk. When preloading all tiles in a tileset, the number of threads originally
 * got out of hand for saving tiles. This queue allows a group of threads to be reused to do the
 * work. It can also be used to manage the threads for sending tile requests out, but there should
 * be a separate queue for each.
 * 
 * NOTE: This class is not intended to be subclassed or extended.
 * 
 * This class us based on the code example "Java theory and practice: Thread pools and work queues"
 * 
 * @see http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-jtp0730.html
 * 
 *      This class can be replaced with {@link Executor} now that Doug Lee's work is included in
 *      Java.
